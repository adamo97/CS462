1. What design decisions did you make in your rulesets that made this assignment easier or harder? Why? 
	I used a single global function in my sensor_profil.krl that I then shared and provided that allowed it to be queried and used in a module.
	This is needed to see the data and also to use it in the wovyn_base.
	I also used an always block to assign values to the ent variables

2. Explain how the sensor_profile ruleset isolates state and processes regarding the sensor profile from other rulesets. 
	The entity variables are only changed when an event is raised.  These entity variables are then checked to make sure they are not null or an empty string
	and then just the map that contains the information is shared.

3. How do other rulesets use the sensor_profile to get data?
	Because the profile_data function is shared and provided it is able to be queried and also able to be used in a module for other rulesets.
	The wovyn_base uses the profile data function to see what number to text as well as what the threshold is.

4. Could they use it to store new values? How?
	Other rulesets would need to raise an event in order to store new values. Much like how events are raised in the wovyn_base.
