Why does this assignment ask you to create a function for messages but an action for sending the SMS message? What's the difference? 
	- an action should be used for API requests that change state.  POST changes state (when we send a message) and GET does not
	- using GET in a function ensures that operations in an API that affect external state can be guarded by a rule's conditional
	and any calls made in the prelude or event expression will not change state


Why did we introduce the secrets for the Twilio module by configuring the rule that uses the module, rather than configuring the module directly?
	- we want to keep the secrets out of the files so that they aren't recorded in version control (keep them secret)
	- configuring the rule that uses the module, rather than the module directly makes the API reusable. Specifying the secrets in the
	rule that uses the module allows us to choose what secrets we use for what operations.  This also allows us to limit what operations
	specific secrets have access to.
