Can a sensor be in more than one collection based on the code you wrote? Why or why not? What are the implications of a sensor being in more than one collection?

Yes, a sensor can be in more than one collection.  Every time a report is requested a new correlation id is created and the responses belong to a new collection.
The implication is that you have duplicate data (if the sensor doesn't have any new data).

How could you ensure that only certain picos can raise an event that causes a temperature report to be generated?

Only install the ruleset that has the rule that requests the report in the picos you want to raise the event.
Other than that, the way the the rule is implemented it needs the Rx and Tx relations in order to send the events back and forth.

How do the debug logs show that your scatter-gather system worked?

When I call report:request I see a response from every sensor

How can you know a report is done and all the sensors that are going to respond have reported? 

Keep track of how many sensors there are total and keep a separate counter that tracks how many have responded with the given correlation id.

Given your answer above, how would you recover if the number of responding sensors is less than the total number of sensors?

If you want your system to continue to respond to events don't block while waiting for all sensors to respond.  Use a correlation id so that if/when
the response does come back you know which request to put the data with.  If you wanted to you could also have a rule that would query the sensors that didnt respond
if they took too long.  You could also simply notify some other system that a sensor isn't responding by comparing the total number of sensors that were requested and
how many responded.
